# Developing-and-Evaluating-a-Baseline-Neural-Network-Model-for-MNIST-Digit-Classification
Description:
This project involves the development, training, and evaluation of a baseline neural network model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset, a well-known benchmark in machine learning, contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, each labeled with the correct digit from 0 to 9.

The process begins with loading the MNIST dataset using Keras' built-in dataset utilities. Initial exploration and visualization of the dataset provide insights into its structure and contents. Each image, originally 28x28 pixels, is flattened into a 784-dimensional vector to prepare it for neural network input.

Normalization of the pixel values from the original 0-255 range to a 0-1 range is performed to improve the efficiency and convergence of the neural network during training. Additionally, the labels are one-hot encoded to facilitate multi-class classification.

A simple yet effective neural network model is constructed using Keras' Sequential API. The model architecture includes an input layer that matches the 784-dimensional input vector, followed by a dense hidden layer with ReLU activation and an output layer with a softmax activation function to handle the 10-class classification problem.

After defining the model architecture, a summary of the model is displayed to verify its structure and parameter count. The model is then compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, chosen for their effectiveness in multi-class classification tasks.

The training process involves fitting the model to the training data, with validation performed on the test data. Initial training parameters include 10 epochs and a batch size of 200, with potential adjustments to these parameters in future iterations to optimize performance.

Finally, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set, with accuracy metrics reported. The baseline error, representing the percentage of incorrect classifications, is calculated and presented. This evaluation provides a benchmark for further improvements and optimizations in subsequent models.

By systematically preprocessing the data, constructing a neural network model, and evaluating its performance, this project establishes a solid foundation for MNIST digit classification and sets the stage for future enhancements and experimentation.
